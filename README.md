# ActivityRadar

A mobile app for finding public sports facilities in your neighborhood

## Setup

The first point of setup is installing `flutter`. For that, consult the
[official guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/) for your OS.

Make sure, that everything is well installed with `flutter doctor`.

The currently required Dart sdk version is `>=3.1.0-129.0.dev <4.0.0`.
Check your current sdk version with `dart --version`. If it is too low, it might
be necessary to switch to a different release channel of flutter:

```
flutter channel beta
flutter upgrade
```

After making sure, everything is set up correctly, install the project
dependencies by running.

```
flutter pub get
```

## Run

Connect your device or start an emulator and run:

```
flutter run
```
